
To perform this lab it is recommended to use a second server with the name nfsserver. If that's not possible, configure the NFS server parts on localhost

On nfsserver, create home directories /home/ldap/ldapuser1 .. Idapuser9

Configure nfsserver to NFS export these home directories

Automount the home directories on /homes/. The result should be that /homes/ldapusern is accessed, the corresponding directory from nfsserver is mounted
