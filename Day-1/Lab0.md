# Lab 0: Basic Shell Operations

This lab focuses on shell environment configuration, command discovery, and output redirection.

## Tasks

1. Modify your shell environment so that on every subshell that is started, a variable is set. The name of the variable should be LOGGEDUSER, and the value should be set to user. Verify that it is working.

2. Use the appropriate tools to find the command that you can use to change a user password. Do you need root permissions to use this command?

3. From your home directory, type the command `ls -al wergihl *` and ensure that errors as well as regular output are redirected to a file with the name /tmp/lsoutput.
